# Hashtable Implementation

## Collaborators: Brendon H
### Hashtables
Problem Domain:
Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:

`set`
 - Arguments: key, value
 - Returns: nothing
 - This method should hash the key, and set the key and value pair in the table, handling collisions as needed.
Should a given key already exist, replace its value from the value argument given to this method.

`get`
 - Arguments: key
 - Returns: Value associated with that key in the table

`contains`
 - Arguments: key
 - Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

`keys`
 - Returns: Collection of keys

`hash`
 - Arguments: key
 - Returns: Index in the collection for that key
