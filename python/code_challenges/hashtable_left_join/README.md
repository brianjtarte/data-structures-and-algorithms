# Hashtable Left Join

## Collaborators: Jae and Aoife
### Hashtable Left Join
- Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.

- Write a function called left join
  - Arguments: two hash maps
  - The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
  - The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
  - Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic

## Approach & Efficiency
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n + m)
